# Writing Guidelines

These practical guidelines help ensure all our communications are clear, consistent, and aligned with our brand voice. Use them as a reference for any content you create for our brand.

## Grammar & Style {#grammar-style}

### Capitalization
- **Sentence case for headlines and headings** (not title case)
- **Proper nouns and brand names** get initial caps
- **Our brand name** is always "Brand Guidelines" (two words)
- **Avoid all caps** except for acronyms

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Building authentic brand connections"
- ❌ "Building Authentic Brand Connections"
- ✅ "Brand Guidelines team"
- ❌ "brand guidelines team"

### Punctuation
- **Oxford comma**: Always use it
- **Periods in headlines**: Only if it's a complete sentence
- **Quotation marks**: Use for actual quotes, not emphasis
- **Ellipses**: Use sparingly (... not ...)

### Numbers and Dates
- **Spell out numbers** one through nine, use numerals for 10+
- **Dates**: March 15, 2024 (no ordinal indicators)
- **Times**: 3 p.m. (lowercase with periods)
- **Percentages**: Use numerals (15%, not fifteen percent)

### Contractions
- **Use them** to sound conversational and approachable
- **Common ones**: we're, you're, it's, don't, can't
- **Avoid in formal documents** like contracts or proposals

### Acronyms and Abbreviations
- **Spell out on first use** with acronym in parentheses
- **Use acronyms** only if they save space and aid clarity
- **Don't use periods** in acronyms (CEO, not C.E.O.)

## Content Structure {#content-structure}

### Headlines and Subheadings
- **Make them descriptive** and scannable
- **Use active voice** when possible
- **Include keywords** for SEO when appropriate
- **Keep them conversational** but informative

**Examples:**
- ✅ "How to build authentic brand connections"
- ❌ "Methodologies for brand relationship optimization"

### Paragraph Structure
- **Start with key information** (inverted pyramid)
- **Keep paragraphs short** (2-4 sentences online, longer for print)
- **One main idea** per paragraph
- **Use transitions** to connect ideas

### Lists and Bullet Points
- **Use parallel structure** (all items start similarly)
- **Keep items concise** but complete
- **Use bullets for unordered** lists, numbers for sequences
- **Introduce lists** with a clear setup sentence

**Example:**
Our approach includes:
- Research and discovery
- Strategic planning
- Creative development
- Implementation support

### Call-to-Action Writing
- **Use action verbs** (download, explore, discover, learn)
- **Be specific** about what happens next
- **Create urgency** when appropriate
- **Make the benefit clear**

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Download our brand strategy guide"
- ❌ "Click here for information"

## Digital Communication {#digital-guidelines}

### Email Guidelines
- **Subject lines**: Clear, specific, under 50 characters
- **Opening**: Warm but professional greeting
- **Body**: Get to the point quickly, use short paragraphs
- **Closing**: Clear next steps and professional sign-off

**Email Template:**
```
