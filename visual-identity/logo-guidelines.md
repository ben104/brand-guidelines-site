# Logo Guidelines

Our logo is the most recognizable element of our brand identity. These guidelines ensure consistent and appropriate usage across all applications, maintaining the integrity and recognition of our brand.

## Logo Variations {#logo-variations}

We have several logo variations to accommodate different applications and contexts:

### Primary Logo
The primary logo should be used whenever possible. It includes our full brand name and symbol in horizontal layout.

**Usage:**
- Website headers
- Business cards
- Email signatures
- Marketing materials
- Presentations

**Format Available:** 
- Vector: AI, EPS, SVG
- Raster: PNG (transparent), JPG

### Stacked Logo
For situations where horizontal space is limited, use the stacked version with the symbol above the wordmark.

**Usage:**
- Social media profiles
- Mobile applications
- Vertical layouts
- Square formats

### Symbol/Icon Only
The standalone symbol can be used when the brand name is clearly established in context.

**Usage:**
- Favicons
- App icons
- Watermarks
- Pattern elements
- Social media avatars (when brand is established)

### Wordmark Only
Text-only version for situations where the symbol may not reproduce well.

**Usage:**
- Very small applications
- Single-color printing
- Text-heavy contexts
- Legal documents

### Monogram
Simplified version using initials only for very constrained spaces.

**Usage:**
- Extremely small applications
- Embossing/debossing
- Pattern fills
- Minimal branding contexts

## Clear Space {#clear-space}

Maintain adequate clear space around the logo to ensure visual impact and readability.

### Clear Space Rules
- **Minimum clear space**: Equal to the height of the "B" in the wordmark
- **Recommended clear space**: 1.5x the height of the "B" for maximum impact
- **No other elements** should appear within the clear space area

### Clear Space Applications
- **Digital**: Maintain clear space even when logo is part of a grid system
- **Print**: Account for trim and fold lines when calculating clear space
- **Signage**: Consider viewing distance and environmental factors

## Minimum Sizes {#minimum-sizes}

To ensure legibility and maintain brand integrity, never use the logo smaller than these minimum sizes:

### Digital Applications
- **Primary Logo**: 120px wide (minimum)
- **Stacked Logo**: 80px wide (minimum)
- **Symbol Only**: 32px x 32px (minimum)
- **Wordmark**: 100px wide (minimum)

### Print Applications
- **Primary Logo**: 1 inch wide (minimum)
- **Stacked Logo**: 0.75 inches wide (minimum)
- **Symbol Only**: 0.25 inches (minimum)
- **Wordmark**: 0.875 inches wide (minimum)

### Size Guidelines
- When in doubt, go larger rather than smaller
- Test legibility at actual output size
- Consider viewing distance and medium
- Maintain proportions when scaling

## Color Usage {#color-usage}

### Primary Color Applications

#### Full Color (Preferred)
- Use on white or light backgrounds

### Color Guidelines
- Never use colors outside the approved brand palette
- Ensure minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for accessibility
- Test color combinations across different media
- Consider color reproduction capabilities of output method

### Backgrounds
- **Preferred**: White or very light backgrounds
- **Acceptable**: Light gray (#F5F5F5) or subtle textures
- **Avoid**: Busy backgrounds that compete with the logo
- **Dark backgrounds**: Use white/reversed version only

## Placement Guidelines {#placement-guidelines}

### Hierarchy and Positioning
- Logo should be prominent but not dominate the design
- Position consistently across all brand materials
- Consider reading patterns (top-left for Western audiences)
- Maintain visual balance with other elements

### Common Placements
- **Headers**: Top-left or center, depending on layout
- **Business Cards**: Top-left or bottom-right

- **Websites**: Header area, typically top-left

### Size Relative to Layout

- Adjust size based on application and context

## Incorrect Usage {#incorrect-usage}
